# Taxinator

A dual frontend and backend project for a middleware platform that standardizes cost-basis data
and delivers tax-engine ready payloads.

## Structure

- `backend/`: FastAPI service for ingesting, validating, and transforming cost-basis data.
- `frontend/`: React + Vite dashboard for configuring integrations and monitoring pipelines.

## Getting started

Each workspace can be bootstrapped independently. Refer to the README within `backend/` and
`frontend/` for environment-specific instructions.
